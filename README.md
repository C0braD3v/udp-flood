# udp-flood
This is a UDP packet flooding script i created for my Science Fare at school. This script is to be used for educational purposes ONLY! DoS attacks are illegal, and i am in no way responsible for any damages or misuse of this script. Only use this script on yourself, or with the written consent of a server or network owner, for education reasons. This script is dangerous, and will flood your server with UDP packets. Use at your own risk!
